An emotion classification project which takes image files captured from human face and predicts the emotion conveyed from the facial expression. Please visit the application [here](https://fervi.herokuapp.com/) to explore the project and its capabilities including real-time video emotion classification and real-time graphs.

## DATASETS USED

1. [FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013)
   <br />
   <p>The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The seven categories in the dataset are: (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The data set has three columns: "emotion", "pixels", and "Usage". The "emotion" column contains a numeric code ranging from 0 to 6, inclusive, for the emotion that is present in the image. The "pixels" column contains a string surrounded in quotes for each image. The contents of this string a space-separated pixel values in row major order. The "Usage" column indicates which images are for Training(80%), Public Test(10%), and Private Test(10%). This dataset ontains 35,887 images. This dataset was prepared by Pierre-Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville, as part of an ongoing research project. They have graciously provided the workshop organizers with a preliminary version of their dataset to use for this contest.</p>

2. [The Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davilsena/ckdataset)
   <br>
   <p>This dataset contains 920 images from 920 original CK+ dataset. Data is already reshaped to 48x48 pixels, in grayscale format and facecropped using haarcascade_frontalface_default. Noisy (based on room light/hair format/skin colour) images were adapted to be clearly identified using Haar classifier. Columns from file are defined as emotion/pixels/Usage. Emotions are defined as:
   
   0 : Anger     (45 samples)

   1 : Disgust   (59 samples)

   2 : Fear      (25 samples)

   3 : Happiness (69 samples)

   4 : Sadness   (28 samples)

   5 : Surprise  (83 samples)

   6 : Neutral   (593 samples)

   7 : Contempt  (18 samples)
   
   Pixels contains 2304 pixels (48x48) each row.
   
   Usage is determined as Training(80%) / PublicTest(10%) / PrivateTest(10%).
   
   This dataset was first developed to make a comparison to [ROHIT VERMA - FER2013].</p>
